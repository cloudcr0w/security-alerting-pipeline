  End-to-end real-time threat detection and alerting system built on AWS with Terraform and Python Lambda functions.
  Hands-on DevSecOps project showing real-time AWS security monitoring and alerting.

## Initial Use Case
> Detect and alert when a new IAM user is created (`CreateUser` event in AWS CloudTrail).

---

## Use Case
Detects suspicious activity like:
- IAM user creation  
- Root login without MFA  
- GuardDuty findings (SSH brute-force, port scan)  
- AWS Config non-compliant resources (e.g., public S3)

---

## Stack

| Category      | Technology                         |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| IaC           | Terraform                          |
| Detection     | CloudTrail, GuardDuty, AWS Config  |
| Processing    | Lambda (Python)                    |
| Alerting      | SNS, Slack                         |
| Optional UI   | Flask receiver in Docker/K8s       |

## Architecture

![AWS Security Alerting Pipeline](diagram.png)

1. CloudTrail or GuardDuty detects an event  
2. EventBridge filters and routes the event  
3. Lambda formats the alert and sends via SNS  
4. Alerts go to email, Slack, or an external receiver

k8s/ # Kubernetes deployment manifests
```

## 🔔 Slack Integration – Alert Example

This is a real example of a manual test alert sent via AWS Lambda → SNS → Slack.  
The alert was triggered by a Lambda function subscribed to an SNS topic:

## What I Learned

- How to use Terraform to deploy a real security alerting pipeline  
- How IAM, GuardDuty, EventBridge, Lambda, and SNS integrate  
- How to log to CloudWatch and test Lambda manually  
- Hands-on experience with GuardDuty in a personal project  
- Basics of Docker and Kubernetes for alert receiver deployment

---
## Why This Project?

The AWS Security Alerting Pipeline was created to:
- Gain hands-on experience with Terraform, Lambda, SNS, and security services
- Build a real-world cloud monitoring & alerting use case
- Demonstrate cloud infrastructure skills and DevSecOps thinking
- Provide actionable Slack/email alerts on suspicious activities in near real-time

## 🚧 TODO

Planned improvements and features:

- [ ] ☁️ Add CloudWatch Alarms for specific metrics (e.g., unauthorized API calls)
- [ ] 📦 Deploy alert-receiver to ECS (Fargate) or EKS with proper Terraform setup
- [ ] 🔐 Integrate secrets manager for storing Slack webhook URL securely
- [ ] 📊 Add CloudWatch dashboard for visual monitoring
- [ ] 🔄 Enable automatic rotation of Lambda access keys
- [ ] 🧪 Add more unit tests for Lambda functions (pytest)
- [ ] 🛠️ Implement CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure and Lambda (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] 🌍 Add multi-region support
- [ ] 🧩 Add additional EventBridge rules (e.g., for API Gateway abuse or EC2 activity)
- [ ] 📁 Archive alerts to S3 for long-term storage & audit
- [ ] 📖 Write a blog post or LinkedIn article describing project use case and learnings
