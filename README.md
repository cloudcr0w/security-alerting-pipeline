## Initial Use Case
> Detect and alert when a new IAM user is created (`CreateUser` event in AWS CloudTrail).

---

## Use Case
Detects suspicious activity like:
- IAM user creation  
- Root login without MFA  
- GuardDuty findings (SSH brute-force, port scan)  
- AWS Config non-compliant resources (e.g., public S3)

## Architecture

![AWS Security Alerting Pipeline](diagram.png)

1. CloudTrail or GuardDuty detects an event  
2. EventBridge filters and routes the event  
3. Lambda formats the alert and sends via SNS  
4. Alerts go to email, Slack, or an external receiver
