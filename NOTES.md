# 🗒️ Notes – AWS Security Alerting Pipeline

Still working on, trying to improve and learn

## ✅ Done (Thu, Mar 28)

- Added tags to both Lambda functions
- Added outputs for `guardduty_alert_function`
- Verified `alert_email` variable has description
- Kept daily commit streak alive 💪

## 📌 TODO

- Add quick Slack integration via webhook?
- Consider separate SNS topic for GuardDuty alerts
- Test GuardDuty event manually in AWS Console

## 🤔 Questions for later

- How would I route alerts to different recipients based on severity?
- What would CloudWatch Logs integration look like?

# 📝 Weekend Plan (March 29–30)

- ✅ Clean Docker image naming (e.g., add `tag`)
- 🔲 Try running GuardDuty Lambda with sample alert
- 🔲 Add README to samples/ folder
- 🔲 Reflect on CI/CD ideas (what could I automate?)
